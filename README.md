Amazon Product Engagement Analysis
A complete data science pipeline project. Transforming raw e-commerce data into actionable business intelligence using Python (Pandas), PostgreSQL, and interactive Power BI dashboards.

📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes a raw dataset of Amazon product listings to identify key drivers of customer engagement and pricing effectiveness. The goal was to move from messy, unstructured text data to a structured database and finally to an executive-grade dashboard.

🎯 Key Business Insights
Through the analysis, three major strategies were identified:

Niche Dominance: While "Electronics" holds the most inventory, "Musical Instruments" generates the highest per-product engagement.
Discount Strategy: A "Medium" discount strategy yields higher engagement than aggressive "Very High" discounts.
Brand Power: Amazon's private labels (Amazon Basics) dominate the top engagement slots, proving brand trust drives volume.
🛠 Tech Stack
Python: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA using Pandas.
PostgreSQL: Backend data storage, complex querying, and view creation.
Power BI: Interactive data visualization and executive dashboarding.
